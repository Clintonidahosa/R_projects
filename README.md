# R Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of R projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. The projects involve working with various datasets to extract insights, perform exploratory data analysis, and implement predictive modeling techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- Data manipulation and cleaning using `dplyr` and `tidyr`
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Data visualization techniques with `ggplot2`
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms
- Report generation and documentation with R Markdown

## Project Highlights:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducting comprehensive analyses to uncover patterns and trends in datasets.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developing models using techniques such as linear regression and decision trees to forecast outcomes.
- **Health Data Analysis:** Analyzing healthcare datasets to derive insights into patient demographics, treatment efficacy, and clinical outcomes.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating impactful visualizations to effectively communicate findings and support data-driven decision-making.

Feel free to explore the R scripts and insights derived from each project!
